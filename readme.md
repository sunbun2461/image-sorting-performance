Sure, I'll expand the README with more details and include the Perl backend component as well as the location for images within the project structure.

# Advanced Image Sorting & Performance Visualization Tool

## Project Overview

This application showcases the efficiency and performance of different sorting algorithms through the lens of image organization. It combines a Perl backend for image handling with a JavaScript frontend for interactive visualization and performance metrics. This hybrid approach offers a comprehensive learning experience, demonstrating not only algorithmic efficiency but also the practical application of these algorithms in a real-world scenario.

### Objectives

- **Interactive Learning**: Provide an engaging way to learn about algorithm efficiency and Big O notation.
- **Performance Comparison**: Allow users to directly compare the performance of various algorithms in organizing a large dataset of images.
- **Real-World Application**: Demonstrate how backend (Perl) and frontend (JavaScript) can work together in a practical application.
- **Educational Enhancement**: Future integration with the ChatGPT API to offer insights and explanations about the best algorithmic choices based on specific criteria.

## Technologies Used

- **Perl**: Utilized for backend logic, including image fetching, preprocessing, and database interactions. Perl's powerful text and image processing capabilities make it ideal for these tasks.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Used to create an interactive and responsive web interface. JavaScript plays a crucial role in dynamically updating the UI based on user interactions and algorithm performance.
- **ChatGPT API** (planned): Aimed at enriching the application by providing detailed explanations and recommendations on algorithm choices, leveraging OpenAI's language model for educational content.

## Setup and Running the Project

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. **Set up the Perl environment**: Ensure Perl is installed, and install any required CPAN modules.
3. **Prepare the frontend**: Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser to interact with the application.
4. **Image Preparation**: Place initial images in the `data/images/` directory for processing.
5. **Run Backend Scripts**: Execute Perl scripts for image processing and setup as needed before using the frontend application.

## Future Enhancements

- **ChatGPT Integration**: Incorporating ChatGPT API to provide contextual explanations and algorithm selection advice based on efficiency and use case.
- **Algorithm Expansion**: Adding more sorting and organizing algorithms for a broader comparison.
- **User Interaction**: Enhancing user engagement through features like image upload, sorting preference settings, and personalized performance insights.
